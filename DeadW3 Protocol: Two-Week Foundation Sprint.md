## Success Criteria

The sprint achieves success when the following conditions are met:

**Technical Completeness:** All repositories are created with proper configuration, comprehensive READMEs, and working CI/CD pipelines. Smart contracts are deployed to testnet with verified source code. The storage, verification, indexing, and API layers demonstrate functional proof-of-concept implementations.

**Testing Quality:** Unit tests provide adequate coverage for all components. Integration tests demonstrate end-to-end workflows from submission through verification to indexing. All tests run automatically in CI pipelines.

**Documentation Standards:** Every repository includes setup instructions that enable new developers to contribute. Architecture documentation explains system design and component interactions. At least one Architecture Decision Record captures significant technical choices with rationale.

**Operational Readiness:** Development environment setup completes in under thirty minutes following documentation. Docker Compose configurations allow running the full stack locally. Deployment procedures are documented for production environments.

**Demonstration Capability:** A complete show can be uploaded through the CLI tool, verified by the service, indexed into the database, and retrieved via the API, proving the core protocol workflow functions correctly.

---

## Risk Management

**Technical Risks:** Complex integration between multiple systems may reveal unexpected incompatibilities. Mitigation involves incremental integration testing and maintaining clear interface contracts between components.

**Timeline Risks:** Ambitious two-week timeline may encounter blockers from external dependencies like testnet availability or library compatibility. Mitigation involves identifying critical path items early and maintaining flexible scope boundaries.

**Resource Risks:** Single developer implementing across multiple technology stacks may encounter knowledge gaps. Mitigation involves leveraging comprehensive documentation from libraries and frameworks, and remaining flexible about technology choices when blockers arise.

**Dependency Risks:** External services like Bundlr, Arweave, and Base network may experience downtime during development. Mitigation involves implementing local mocks for testing and graceful degradation patterns.

---

## Notes

This sprint plan emphasizes foundation-building over feature completeness. The objective is establishing clean architecture, reliable infrastructure, and comprehensive documentation that accelerates future development. Many components will be implemented as functional proofs-of-concept requiring refinement before production readiness. This approach allows validating technical assumptions and architecture decisions before investing in polish and optimization.

The checkbox format enables tracking progress daily and provides clear visibility into sprint status. Each section builds logically on previous work, creating natural dependencies that guide implementation sequencing. Regular commits and documentation updates throughout the sprint ensure knowledge capture and enable course corrections as needed.
